    <h1>Radio Traffic Only Standard Operating Procedures</h1>
    <p>APPLIES TO: ALL DISPATCHERS</p>
    <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
    <p>
        North View Regional Communications Center [NRCC] has implemented Radio Traffic Only Standard Operating Procedures [RTOSOP] to ensure efficient radio communications on our frequencies. We understand no one situation is the same, there for certain aspects will be kept broad. If you have any questions please reach out to Dispatch Director Elizabeth Chase [C-100]<br />
        You will be dispatching for FIRE/EMS and Law Enforcement [LE]. The agencies include:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            San Andreas Fire Rescue [SAFR] [FIRE/EMS]*
        </li>
        <li>
            SanFire [FIRE]
        </li>
        <li>
            Divided Emergency Medical Service [DEMS] [EMS]
        </li>
        <li>
            Blaine County Sheriff's Office  [BCSO] [LE]
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        You will be known as different identifiers on the radio depending on who you are communicating with. For SAFR and SanFire you are known as LS; For BCSO you are known as Control; and for DEMS you are known as North View when transmitting and any professional identifier when recieving. When any unprofessional identifier is used you must tell the unit “North View, Callsign try previous transmission again”. <br /><br />

        *SAFR’s EMS side is only dispatched when DEMS is inactive or overwhelmed.
